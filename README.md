# UOX

**Ultima Offline eXperiment ** - This is a c++17 immplementation, loosely based off UOX3. The project is in very early stages, and focussed on learning and fun.  A true hobby project.  It is intended to work equally well on Windows, macOS (arm/intel), and Linux. The primary development is performed on M1 Ultra macOS.


UOX relies on **zlib-1.2.11** for data compression matters, and comes bundled for windows.  Linux builds should install it prior to buidling.  macOS has zlib installed with the os.
