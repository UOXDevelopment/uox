/*
  Removal
  This allows one to remove sections.  One should be in the configuration
  directory and the definition directory (to handle the difference section categories)
  
  It should not be part of the distro, but an example for users to include in their 
  user directories (to remove items from the standard distro 
  without editing the data directory)
  
  [sectiontype:remove] // sectiontype should be the type of section , repeat the section for each section type
  {
  	id = sectionidentifier   // repeated for each id of the sections of this type to
  							  // be deleted
  }
